       In badminton, a service must be hit diagonally into the opponent's service box, with the shuttle below the server's waist. Both feet must be stationary on the court until the shuttle is hit. In singles, the server switches service boxes based on score (even on the right, odd on the left), while in doubles, players alternate service within their team.
